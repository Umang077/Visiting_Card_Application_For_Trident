📇 Visiting Card Digitization App – Built for Trident Group during my Internship!
An intelligent, cross-platform React Native app designed to replace outdated manual visiting card entry processes — and launched in just 25 days to meet a strategic goal from the Chairman’s office.

🔍 What It Does:

Seamlessly scans physical visiting cards using AWS Textract, extracting contact details (name, phone, email, company) with 95%+ accuracy, powered by AI/ML.

Displays extracted data in a clean, searchable table view, enabling employees to access and manage 500+ contacts anytime, anywhere.

Optimized for both iOS and Android, enhancing user experience, flexibility, and overall productivity across departments.

📈 Impact:
Streamlined company-wide contact management, accelerated workflows, and contributed directly to Trident's long-term vision of going paperless — one smart app at a time.
